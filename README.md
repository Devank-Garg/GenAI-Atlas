## ðŸ“Œ About
Generative AI is evolving at lightning speed. This project aims to create a **structured, open-source hub** where anyone can:  
- Learn the fundamentals of **LLMs, Agentic AI, and fine-tuning**  
- Explore curated **resources, tutorials, and Jupyter notebooks**  
- Build **real-world mini-projects** with step-by-step guides  
- Collaborate and **contribute new knowledge back to the community**  

Our mission is to **simplify the chaos** of the GenAI ecosystem into a clear, actionable roadmap for both **beginners** and **practitioners**.
