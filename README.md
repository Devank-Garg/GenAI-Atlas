## 📌 About
Generative AI is evolving at lightning speed. This project aims to create a **structured, open-source hub** where anyone can:  
- Learn the fundamentals of **LLMs, Agentic AI, and fine-tuning**  
- Explore curated **resources, tutorials, and Jupyter notebooks**  
- Build **real-world mini-projects** with step-by-step guides  
- Collaborate and **contribute new knowledge back to the community**  

Our mission is to **simplify the chaos** of the GenAI ecosystem into a clear, actionable roadmap for both **beginners** and **practitioners**.

### 📚 Roadmap

The roadmap is divided into these key pillars:

* **LLMs** → definition, terminology, open/closed-source
* **Getting Started** → APIs, RAG, serving
* **Agentic AI** → tool calling, frameworks, agents
* **LLM Training** → SFT, PEFT, RLHF, fine-tuning
* **Industry** → use cases, best practices, compliance

📍 See the [full roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.
