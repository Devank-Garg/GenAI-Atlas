# üó∫ GenAI-Atlas Roadmap

This roadmap organizes the world of **Generative AI, LLMs, and Agentic AI** into a structured flow.  
It‚Äôs meant to guide both **beginners** and **practitioners** step by step.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Large Language Models (LLMs)
- What are LLMs?  
- Basic terminologies  
- Open-source vs Closed-source models  
- Model architectures (Transformer, encoder-decoder, decoder-only)  
- Evaluation metrics (perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, preference models)  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started
- API usage (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)  
- Model serving basics  
- Prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency)  
- Embeddings and vector databases (FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Agentic AI
- Tool calling (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, MCP)  
- Memory (short-term vs long-term memory in agents)  
- Multi-agent systems & orchestration  
- Sample agents (basic assistant, code agent)  
- Advanced RL-based agents  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ LLM Training
- Pretraining  
- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)  
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT, LoRA, adapters)  
- Preference alignment (DPO, PPO, RLHF)  
- Knowledge distillation & model compression  
- Deployment optimization (quantization, pruning, distillation)  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Industry Adoption
- Use cases (chatbots, copilots, domain-specific assistants)  
- Best practices (evaluation, safety, bias reduction)  
- Compliance & governance (GDPR, EU AI Act, ethical AI)  
- Deployment strategies (cloud vs on-device, cost optimization)  
- Hype vs reality  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Multimodal Generative AI
- Vision models (Diffusion, GANs, CLIP, Stable Diffusion)  
- Audio & speech (TTS, STT, music generation)  
- Video generation (text-to-video, video editing)  
- Multimodal foundation models (Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos, DeepSeek-VL)  

---

## üéØ Future Directions
- Reasoning-focused LLMs (OpenAI o1, DeepSeek models)  
- Neuro-symbolic hybrids  
- Multi-agent ecosystems  
- AI governance and policy
